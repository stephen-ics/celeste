<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Celeste is a turing-complete compiler that comprises of a lexer, parser, abstract syntax tree (AST), compiler, and virtual machine (VM). Every component is meticulously tested to deliver a robust and reliable compiler.

In this language, all expressions, including functions, are treated as first-class citizens. This means you have the power to pass functions as parameters, return them from other functions, assign them to variables, and manipulate them just like any other data type. This flexibility opens doors to creative and elegant coding solutions, enabling you to craft expressive and modular programs.
